## A Brief of the Prototype:
  This section must include UML Daigrms and prototype description
  
## Tech Stack:

   Ultralytics 
   OneAPI-OneDNN-OpenVINO
   

   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  This Section must contain set of instructions required to clone and run the prototype, so that it can be tested and deeply analysed
  
## What I Learned:
   Key learning points during this phase was learning to integrate OneAPI along with our Object detection ML model
   By using the OpenVINO toolkit which is a part of OneDNN, we use the OpenVINO inference engine to perfrom
   accelerated computing of model detection which is gives a result of 7ms than the conventional YOLOX inference of 70ms
   
   Building application using intel oneDAL:The Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) contributes to the acceleration of big data     analysis by providing highly optimised algorithmic building blocks for all phases of data analytics (preprocessing, transformation,       analysis, modelling, validation, and decision making) in batch, online, and distributed processing modes of computation.The library       optimizes data ingestion along with algorithmic computation to increase throughput and scalability.
