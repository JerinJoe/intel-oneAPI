## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  This Section must contain set of instructions required to clone and run the prototype, so that it can be tested and deeply analysed
  
## What I Learned:
   Key learning points during this phase was learning to integrate OneAPI along with our Object detection ML model
   By using the OpenVINO toolkit which is a part of OneDNN, we use the OpenVINO inference engine to perfrom
   accelerated computing of model detection which is gives a result of 7ms than the conventional YOLOX inference of 70ms
